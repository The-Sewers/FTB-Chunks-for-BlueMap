# FTB Chunks for BlueMap

**Visualize FTB Chunks land claims directly in BlueMap.**

## About

**FTB Chunks for BlueMap** is a straightforward mod designed to seamlessly integrate your FTB Chunks land claims directly into your BlueMap web interface.

With this mod, you can now effortlessly **visualize all chunk claims from FTB Chunks on your BlueMap**, whether you're exploring the top-down 2D map or the immersive 3D world view. This makes it incredibly easy to see where land is claimed on your server, helping you manage and understand your protected areas at a glance.

## Features

*   2D & 3D Visualization: See claims in both the top-down 2D map and the immersive 3D view.
*   Color-Coded Claims: Easily distinguish between different players' claims (requires BlueMap's built-in player coloring or will use a default color).
*   Highly Compatible: Works seamlessly with both FTB Chunks and BlueMap.
*   Lightweight: Designed to be efficient and not impact server performance significantly.
